-- type - to navigate up to the parent directory of the current file/directory
-- type s to open a file with default system application or a folder with default file manager (if you want to change the command used to do it see :h nvim-tree.setup under system_open)
-- if the file is a directory, <CR> will open the directory otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
-- if the file is a symlink, <CR> will follow the symlink (if the target is a file)
-- <C-v> will open the file in a vertical split
-- <C-x> will open the file in a horizontal split
-- <C-t> will open the file in a new tab
-- <Tab> will open the file as a preview (keeps the cursor in the tree)
-- I will toggle visibility of hidden folders / files
-- H will toggle visibility of dotfiles (files/folders starting with a .)
-- R will refresh the tree
-- Double left click acts like <CR>
-- Double right click acts like <C-]>
-- W will collapse the whole tree
-- S will prompt the user to enter a path and then expands the tree to match the path
-- . will enter vim command mode with the file the cursor is on
-- C-k will toggle a popup with file infos about the file under the cursor
--
-- following options are the default
-- each of these are documented in `:help nvim-tree.OPTION_NAME`
